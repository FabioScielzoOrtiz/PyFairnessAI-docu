# Introduction to `PyFairnessAI`

A package for applying a Fairness Machine Learning Workflow (*), focused in classification problems.

The framework includes diverse fairness metrics and processors, as well as model selection algorithms based on both fairness and predictive power. Additionally, this framework allows to combine multiple fairness processors as well as multiple sensitive variables (protected attributes).

This package is mainly inspired in `aif360` and has been designed to work with `scikit-learn`.

(*) Machine Learning Workflow refers to the process of finding the best model for a certain Machine Learning problem and data.
