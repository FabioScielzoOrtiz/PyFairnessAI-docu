# Advantages

The **main advantages** of `PyFairnessAI` with respect to other similar frameworks, like `aif360`, are the following:

- A **combined metric approach** to **measure** **both** the **fairness** and **predictive** **power** of a classification model **at the same time**.

- **Hyper-parameter optimization** of classification algorithms **based on** **both** **fairness** degree and **predictive** **power**.

- Can be used for **finding** the **best classification model** **based on both fairness** and **predictive** **scores**. 

- **Allows** **multi fairness processors** and **multi sensitive variables** (protected attributes).

- **Designed to work with** `scikit-learn` objects.
